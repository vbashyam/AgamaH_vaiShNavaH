      <description>SECOND PĀDA. Speech with mind, on account of this being seen and of scriptural statement. The Sūtras now begin an enquiry into the mode of the going to Brahman of him who knows. At first the soul&amp;rsquo;s departure from the body is considered. On this point we have the text, &amp;lsquo;When a man departs from hence his speech is combined (sampadyate) with his mind, his mind with his breath, his breath with fire, fire with the highest deity&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ.</description>

      <description>And for the same reason all follow after. Because speech&amp;rsquo;s becoming one with mind means only conjunction with the latter, not merging within it; there is also no objection to what Scripture says as to all other organs that follow speech being united with mind.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;speech.&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>That mind in breath, owing to the subsequent clause. That mind, i.e. mind united with all the organs unites itself with breath; not merely the function of mind. This appears from the clause following upon the text quoted above, &amp;lsquo;mind (unites itself) with breath.&amp;rsquo; Here, however, a further doubt suggests itself. The text &amp;lsquo;Mind is made of earth&amp;rsquo; declares earth to be the causal substance of mind, and the text &amp;rsquo;that (viz.</description>

      <description>That (is united) with the ruler, on account of the going to it, and so on. As from the statements that speech becomes united with mind and mind with breath it follows that speech and
mind are united with mind and breath only; so we conclude from the subsequent clause &amp;lsquo;breath with fire&amp;rsquo; that breath becomes united with fire only.&amp;ndash;Against this primā facie view the Sūtra declares &amp;rsquo;that breath becomes united with the ruler of the organs, i.</description>

      <description>With the elements, this being stated by Scripture. There arises the further question whether breath joined with the soul unites itself with fire only or with all the elements combined.&amp;ndash;With fire, so much only being declared by Scripture!&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra sets aside. Breath and soul unite themselves with all the elements; for Scripture declares the soul, when moving out, to consist of all the elements&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Consisting of earth, consisting of water, consisting of fire.</description>

      <description>Not with one; for both declare this. Not with one; because each element by itself is incapable of producing an effect. Such incapability is declared by Scripture and tradition alike. The text &amp;lsquo;Having entered these beings with this jīva soul let me reveal names and forms&amp;ndash;let me make each of these three tripartite&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up.
VI, 3) teaches that the elements were rendered tripartite in order to be capable of evolving names and forms; and of similar import is the following Smr̥ti text, &amp;lsquo;Possessing various powers these (elements), being separate from one another, were unable to produce creatures without combining.</description>

      <description>And it is common up to the beginning of the way; and the immortality (is that which is obtained), without having burned. Is this departure of the soul common to him who knows and him who does not know?&amp;ndash;It belongs to him only who does not know, the Pūrvapakshin holds. For Scripture declares that for him who knows there is no departure, and that hence he becomes immortal then and there (irrespective of any departure of the soul to another place), &amp;lsquo;when all desires which once dwelt in his heart are undone, then the mortal becomes immortal, then he obtains Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Br̥.</description>

      <description>Since, up to the union with that (i.e. Brahman) the texts describe the Saṁsāra state. The immortality referred to must necessarily be understood as not implying dissolution of the soul&amp;rsquo;s connexion with the body, since up to the soul&amp;rsquo;s attaining to Brahman the texts describe the Saṁsāra state. That attaining to Brahman takes place, as will be shown further on, after the soul&amp;ndash;moving on the path the first stage of which is light&amp;ndash;has reached a certain place.</description>

      <description>And the subtle (body persists), on account of a means of knowledge, it being thus observed (in Scripture).
The bondage of him who knows is not, at that stage, dissolved, for this reason also that the subtle body continues to persist.&amp;ndash;How is this known?&amp;ndash;Through a means of knowledge, viz. because it is thus seen in Scripture. For Scripture states that he who knows, when on the path of the gods, enters into a colloquy with the moon and others, &amp;lsquo;he is to reply,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>Hence not in the way of destruction of bondage. It thus appears that the text &amp;lsquo;when all desires which once entered his heart are undone, then does the mortal become immortal, then he obtains Brahman &amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 7), does not mean such immortality as would imply complete destruction of the state of bondage.</description>

      <description>And to that very (subtle body) (there belongs) the warmth, this only being reasonable. It is observed that when a man is about to die there is some warmth left in some part or parts of the gross body. Now this warmth cannot really belong to the gross body, for it is not observed in other parts of that body (while yet there is no reason why it should be limited to some part); but it may reasonably be attributed to the subtle body which may abide in some part of the gross body (and into which the warmth of the entire gross body has withdrawn itself).</description>

      <description>If it be said that on account of the denial (it is not so); we deny this. From the embodied soul; for (that one is) clear, according to some. The contention that the soul of him who knows departs from the body in the same way as other souls do cannot be upheld, since Scripture expressly negatives such departure. For Br̥. Up. IV, 4, at first describes the mode of departure on the part of him who does not possess true knowledge (&amp;lsquo;He taking to himself those elements of light descends into the heart&amp;rsquo; up to &amp;lsquo;after him thus departing the Prāṇa departs&amp;rsquo;); then refers to his assuming another body (&amp;lsquo;he makes to himself another, newer and more beautiful shape&amp;rsquo;); then concludes the account of him who does not possess true knowledge (&amp;lsquo;having attained the end of these works whatever he does here, he again returns from that world to this world of action.</description>

      <description>Smr̥ti also declares this. Smr̥ti also declares that the soul of him who knows departs by means of an artery of the head. &amp;lsquo;Of those, one is situated above which pierces the disc of the sun and passes beyond the world of Brahman; by way of that the soul reaches the highest goal&amp;rsquo; (Yājñ. Smr̥. III, 167).&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;up to the beginning of the road.&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>With the Highest; for thus it says. It has been shown that at the time of departure from the body the soul together with the organs and prāṇas unites itself with the subtle elements, fire and the rest; and the notion that the soul of him who knows forms an exception has been disposed of. The further question now arises whether those subtle elements move on towards producing their appropriate effects, in accordance with the works or the nature of meditation (of some other soul with which those elements join themselves), or unite themselves with the highest Self.</description>

      <description>Non-division, according to statement. Is this union with the highest Self to be understood as ordinary &amp;lsquo;merging,&amp;rsquo; i.e. a return on the part of the effected thing into the condition of the cause (as when the jar is reduced to the condition of a lump of clay), or as absolute non-division from the highest Self, such as is meant in the clauses preceding the text last quoted, &amp;lsquo;Speech is merged in mind&amp;rsquo;?</description>

      <description>A lighting up of the point of the abode of that; having the door illuminated by that (the soul), owing to the power of its knowledge and the application of remembrance of the way which is an element of that (viz. of knowledge), being assisted by him who abides within the heart, (passes out) by way of the hundred and first artery. So far it has been shown that, up to the beginning of the journey, the souls of them as well who possess true knowledge as of those who do not, pass out of the body in the same way.</description>

      <description>Following the rays. Scripture teaches that the soul of him who knows, after having passed forth from the heart by way of the hundred and first artery, follows the rays of the sun and thus reaches the disc of the sun: &amp;lsquo;when he departs from this body he goes upwards by these rays only&amp;rsquo; (eva) (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 6, 5). The idea here suggests itself that the going of the soul cannot be exclusively bound&amp;rsquo; to those rays, since when a man dies during the night it cannot follow tae rays of the sun.</description>

      <description>Should it be said, not in the night; we say, no; because the connexion persists as long as the body does. Scripture also declares this. It is now enquired into whether the soul of him who, while having true knowledge, dies at night reaches Brahman or not. Although, as solar rays exist at night, the soul may move on at night also following those rays; yet, since dying at night is spoken of in the Sūtras as highly objectionable, we conclude that he who dies at night cannot accomplish the highest end of man, viz.</description>

      <description>For the same reason also during the southern progress of the sun. The reasoning stated above also proves that the owner of true knowledge who may happen to die during the southern progress of the sun reaches Brahman. A further doubt, however, arises here. The text &amp;lsquo;He who dies during the sun&amp;rsquo;s southern progress reaches the greatness of the Fathers and union with the moon&amp;rsquo; (Mahānār. Up. 25) declares that he who dies during the southern progress reaches the moon; and the other text &amp;lsquo;when this ceases they return again the same way&amp;rsquo; (Br̥.</description>

      <description>And those two (paths) are, with a view to the Yogins, mentioned as to be remembered. The text quoted does not state an injunction for those about to die, of a special time of death; but there are rather mentioned in it those two matters belonging to Smr̥ti and therefore to be remembered, viz. the two paths&amp;ndash;the path of the Gods and the path of the Fathers&amp;ndash;with a view to those who know and practise Yoga; the text intimating that Yogins should daily think of those paths which are included in Yoga meditation.</description>
