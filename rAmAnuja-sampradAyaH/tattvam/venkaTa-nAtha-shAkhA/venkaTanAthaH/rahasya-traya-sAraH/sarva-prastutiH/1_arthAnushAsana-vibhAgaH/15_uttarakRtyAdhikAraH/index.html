<p>The prapanna, with his eyes fixed on the absence of his own responsibility (bhara) in regard to both what is seen in this life and what is to come hereafter, follows, until the fall of his body, a course of action which is faultless and agreeable ( observing the code of conduct prescribed for his varṇa and his āśrama) and for the sake of delight (in the enjoyment of the auspicious qualities of Bhagavān ) frequently studies Vedānta  with good men, teaches the sweet and noble utterances (of such as Alvars ), always and also listens to them.</p>
<p>THE CODE OF CONDUCT SUITED FOR A PRAPANNA:</p>
<p>The man who has thus done what he should do and infers his proper attainment of niṣṭhā (in svarūpa, upāya and puruṣārtha) should follow the line of conduct described hereunder as long as he lives, like a farmer who, out of a big field fit for use in the adoration of the Lord, gives up a large part and reserves only a small fraction of it as enough for his needs. This adhikārī, namely, the prapanna, who has given up his connection with many things and is still connected with certain things (like the body) should follow a line of conduct which would be most delightful like the successive services rendered by released souls (in heaven). This line of conduct is an end in itself; it has been prescribed for him in the śāstras as required to be done (in certain specific divisions of time); it is a form of service connected by links to the service which is to follow immediately after and is the means of winning the favour of the Master and is also its effect. The following passages indicate this line of conduct; -</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read the books which describe the attributes and qualities of Bhagavān; I listened to other people reading them, I bowed to Him, I worshipped Him always and performed service to Him and thus saw to it that my time was not spent in vain&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men should get rid of their sorrow which is as deep as the sea on account of past karma surrounding the soul, by meditating on those passages which reveal the Lord&rsquo;s qualities. If they should not do so, by what other thought can they get rid of their sorrow while in saṁsāra ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should, without intermission render service to the Lord in all places and in all circumstances and at all times&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Lord is so gracious as to enable me to spend my time always with the passages which describe His qualities in my mouth, with His form alluring the eye and other senses in my mind, and with flowers fit enough for His form in my hands - if I find this grace, what is there unpleasant for me while living here?”</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born to seek flowers that are hard to obtain in order that they may be placed at the Lord&rsquo;s feet&rdquo;</p>
<p>“May I, the sinner that I am, press the tender feet of the Lord which are gently pressed by the incomparably beautiful Lakṣmī  and the other, viz, the goddess of the Earth!”</p>
<p>“This is the only object that I desire – that the Lord should take me into His service for His own satisfaction&rdquo;. &ldquo;We will render service, O Lord, only to Thee&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Lord &lsquo;will be so gracious as to let us gently press His feet in the place where He sleeps&rsquo;&rsquo;, My fingers will keep count when I utter the names of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The days of my starvation are not those on which I do not eat - (they are) the days, if ever they occur, on which I do not constantly meditate saying &ldquo;nāmo Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;&rsquo; and the days on which I do not approach Thy feet with the three Vedas which are (as it were) freshly bloomed flowers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tongue will not praise any one but Thee; I wonder whether Thou wilt suffer any loss of glory by my praise; but I cannot stop praising Thee, for my tongue is not under my control&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mouth does not praise any one but Him&rdquo;,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My shoulders do not bow to anyone but Him&rdquo;,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not look upon my soul which belongs to the Lord as my own, nor will I remain in the company of those mean persons who think so,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May Thou be so gracious as to make me ever meditate on Thee &ldquo;,</p>
<p>&quot; When will these two eyes of mine delight in looking at the forehead of the Lord where the two gems that shed light shine dispelling darkness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not long for birth accompanied with wealth that (only) makes the flesh grow but pray to be born as a bird in the Venkata Hills&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eyes of those who have not seen that Golden Hill which rides on the bird and which, long ago, planted the hill wound with the serpent in the sea and churned it for the sake of nectar &ndash; their eyes are not eyes at all&rdquo; [&ldquo;The eyes of those who have not seen Bhagavān who is a mountain of Gold and who rides on a bird and who, long ago, placed the mountain girdled with the serpent in the sea and churned it for the sake of nectar &ndash; their eyes are not eyes at all&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Likewise also these Sanskrit ślokas :&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not long for the wealth of Brahma or for that of Rudra. I long to be either a kadamba tree or a kunda tree on the backs of the Yamuna (which Śrīkṛṣṇa purified with His holy feet).&rdquo; &ldquo;Take me as Thy servant. There is nothing improper in this. I will attain thereby the satisfaction of serving Thee for whom alone I exist. Thou wilt also obtain the satisfaction of having protected one who has sought Thee as his refuge.&rdquo; &quot; Whether you are awake or asleep, I will render all the service that is required.&rdquo; &ldquo;Live as you may for a hundred years, I will be under you. Order me yourself to do whatever you want in places which you consider beautiful”. “I long only for being the servant of Bhagavān in all my births.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will spend my days thus, rendering the appointed service in each of the five parts of the day and in worshipping Bhagavān with good chandana. flowers and the like - such as I can obtain with my own effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are the ways of service after prapatti which are in keeping with one&rsquo;s essential nature (svarūpa) in spending the time.</p>
<p>THE PRAPANNA SHOULD SEEK SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE:</p>
<p>Further the prapanna should not remain complacently ignorant of what should be known to one in that state, in the presumption that he has already done what should be done. In the state of perfect enjoyment of the Lord, knowledge and love are (both ) essential. Therefore in accordance with the śloka , &ldquo;One *should never beg of the Lord anything but knowledge and love for His holy feet. The man who begs (for other things ) will surely perish &ldquo;, there is nothing improper in desiring knowledge and love of the Lord. It has been said :- &ldquo;The Lord of the yellow raiment has incarnated as the guru to teach the Veda.&rdquo; So the prapanna should learn from such gurus possessed of exclusive devotion to the Lord and having a clear knowledge of (the truth ). He should obtain clear knowledge from them by following the injunction contained in the śloka  - &ldquo;Bow to your guru, place your doubts before him and render service to him, (then) learn from him the true nature of the self. (Your) ācāryas will teach you the truth concerning the self.&rdquo; He should have his knowledge rendered clear and pure, for (the poet) says, &ldquo;Even a man that is dull becomes intelligent by seeking the company of the wise. Muddy water becomes clear and pure by being mixed with the lather from soapnut.&rdquo; It has been said, &ldquo;He whose knowledge of the truth (concerning Bhagavān ) extends up to the enjoyment of the Lord all those who fall within the range of his eyes will be purified of all their sins.&rdquo; So the prapanna should live in close contact with such, as are well established in this knowledge. As stated (in the Gita):- &ldquo;In a tank which is intended for all and for various purposes, one should take only as much (of the water) as is required for one&rsquo;s purposes&rdquo;, the prapanna should determine what he should choose, from among their ways of life and conduct, what is in accordance with his varṇa, his āśrama, his gotra, his character and the like and conduct himself in keeping with that determination and should walk warily lest he should fall into the pitfall of thinking of his own superiority and the inferiority of others, which might arise from his conceit while observing this code of conduct.</p>
<p>Even if, as it occurred to such as Nammalvar and Nāthamunigal, he is blessed with the special grace of the Saviour so as to enjoy the rise of such benefits as the vision (of the Lord), he should feel sure (that it is not due to any merit of his own) as said in, &ldquo;I do not* know what is good and what is bad”, and &ldquo;Even if I know what is good and what is evil, I cannot obtain what is good and avoid what is evil&rdquo; He should see to it that his being destitute of all upāyas (Ākiñcanya) which is due to his svarūpa, his maintenance (sthiti) and his activities (pravṛtti) being entirely dependent (on the Lord) does not suffer any change or loss. He should remember his utter helplessness (kārpaṇya ) as described in the śloka  “I am the abode of all transgressions, I have no means of protecting myself and I have nothing else to attain than Thee&rdquo;, and in such verses as &ldquo;I have not been observing the code of the disciplined life, nor have I keen intelligence&rdquo;, &ldquo;What**can I do? &ldquo;May my * misery be put an end to by Thee ! If thou dost not do so, there is no one else to protect me&rdquo;, &ldquo;I have no other upāya and no other protector,&rdquo; &ldquo;I do not know of any one whom I can hold as the Saviour of my soul!&rdquo; &ldquo;We are such &rsquo;&rsquo; ignorant women belonging to the race of cowherds as eat in forests while grazing the cows there&rdquo;, &ldquo;I have given up the rites pertaining to Brahmins of worshipping the three fires after ablutions&rsquo;&rsquo;, &ldquo;I was not born into any of the four castes wherein one is fit to follow dharma&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am ignorant and of low birth&rdquo;, &ldquo;I have no one to seek for support&rdquo;. &ldquo;Even if Thou dost not remove from me the sufferings due to karma, I have no other refuge than thee,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have not  practised karma yoga; I have not understood the real nature of the disembodied self (i.e) I have not performed Jñānayoga, nor have I bhakti towards Thy holy feet.” (In these Tamil verses and Sanskrit śloka s, the feeling of helplessness is well depicted and the prapanna should realise his owo helplessness by remembering such verses).</p>
<p>Owing to the knowledge of his own unfitness from time immemorial and the loss of the Lord&rsquo;s service which resulted from it, which may cause excessive disgust, the prapanna should not fall into despair which makes one lament in the words of the Alvar saying, “The nature of the man in saṁsāra is such that he identifies himself with the perishing body and calls it &ldquo;I&rdquo;; from it arises alao evil conduct and from it arises again the body that is foul&rdquo;. (Without falling into despair ), he should hearten himself with the succeeding words there :- &ldquo;O&rdquo; Lord of the immortals, Thou wast born into all castes and even from the wombs of animals in Thy eagerness to protect the Jīvas!&rdquo; He should comfort himself with the words of the Saviour who appears in front to save him - the words which are wholesome and sweet like mother&rsquo;s milk (such as “ For the protection of the good and the destruction of the wicked and so also for the establishment of dharma, I am born again and again in every yuga.&rdquo; He should bathe, as it were, in the words (of Bhagavān) which reveal the secret of the avatārs and take courage (from passages like the following) :- &ldquo;Whatever a man may have been in the past, it he lives a righteous life in his old age, it will do him good; his evil deeds in the past will do him no harm&rdquo; and &ldquo;A man may have been wicked in his past life; he may have fed on anything (however impure ); he may have been ungrateful; he may have been a sceptic; in spite of all that, if he earnestly seeks the protection of the Lord, who is the cause of the world, know that that man is faultless owing to the Lord&rsquo;s greatness &ldquo;, &quot; In one half of an instant, a jīva commits a sin which cannot be expiated even in the course of ten thousand kalpas of Brahma. But Thou pardonest him if only he gives up the thought of sinning (again), even though he has transgressed. How wonderful this is !&rdquo; &ldquo;The past is past, what can we do concerning it? The wise man should think of erecting the dam even when the water is flowing,&rdquo; &quot; It is good to die after performing prapatti to the Lord at least in the dying moments&rdquo;</p>
<p>In accordance with this principle, the prapanna should not lament for what is past and without running away at the thought of his past unfitness, he should make himself fit for the future by reflecting on the present fitness which has resulted from the infinite greatness of the Saviour which brooks no questioning, like those who construct a dam for the water that will come up in the future; he should not stray from the path of performing the commands and permissions of the Lord which are in keeping with his present state as a prapanna. As described (by the Alvar), the senses which have become tired with expectations of enjoying the Lord should be rendered fit (to enjoy Him) by means of pure food and service and directed towards such (spiritual) experiences as are available and turned away from the desire for unwholesome objects, like cows that are turned away from stealthily eating the crops.</p>
<p>When people are waiting for the boat in order (to cross the stream) to go to a place of their desire, some of them may avoid playing chess or other game with stakes, as it could not be stopped whenever desired but may be engaged in playing the game without any stakes so that they might be in a position to give up the game (when the boat has come). Though they play merely for the enjoyment (and not for money), they move the pawns (on the board) in strict accordance with the rules of the game. In the same way (though the prapanna does not expect any profit out of it) he performs gladly the rites commanded and permitted by the Supreme Ruler, which are really services to the Lord, in accordance with the specific time and place at which they are ordained for performance. (In performing them), he should resemble not those who drink milk for relief from excess of bile, but like those who have got well easily and quickly with the help of a medicine and who drink milk with pleasure (not as a cure for disease ).</p>
<p>SERVICE TO ARCĀ:</p>
<p>While rendering this service, the prapanna should do such acts of service as are in keeping with the respective relationships between him and the Lord and with the Lord&rsquo;s supreme majesty and easy accessibility; he should do these acts towards the images (arcā) into which the Lord has incarnated for the sake of some devotees with exclusive devotion to Him; for it has been said : &ldquo;He who believes in the eternal form and supreme majesty of the Lord -him, O Pouṣkara, the Lord approaches,&rdquo; &ldquo;In the same way as the water of the ocean taken up by the clouds and let fall (as rain ) becomes fit to be enjoyed by all, Bhagavān whose image has been installed by devotees becomes fit to be served and enjoyed by others&rdquo;. &ldquo;The six qualities like Jñāna are found in transcendent measure in the mantras and in the images (arcā ). They are described in the mantras, and the qualities are found in Bhagavān, since He has, out of His compassion, chosen to abide in these images&rdquo;. This shows the fullness of perfection, &ldquo;He who looks upon the Lord residing in the image as Puruṣottama and beholds Him (again and again) from the pedestal of the foot to the crown on the head his five deadly sins (Mahāpātaka) are destroyed quickly: Is it necessary to state that minor offences, too, perish ? This shows how supremely purificatory the arcā is. And again it is said ;- &ldquo;If men of clouded intellects happen to see Bhagavān abiding in the arcā even by mere chance, all the evil tendencies in them, such as the following, perish :- the thought that the body is the self; the false notion arising from it that he sees the soul by perception; false conclusions arrived at by fallacious reasoning, false inferences resulting from wrong premises, false interpretations of scriptural texts and want of faith in the Śāstras.&rdquo; Thus the worship of the image (arcā ) is a panacea for all mental diseases arising from a false understanding of cause and effect.</p>
<p>The prapanna should meditate on the Lord&rsquo;s placing Himself at the disposal of those who seek His protection in a manner which cannot be understood by the mind or described in words, for it has been said, &ldquo;Whoever wants to see me and in whatever form - to him I reveal myself in that very form.&rdquo; The same thing is stated also (in the Tamil verse) &ldquo;He assumes the form desired by His devotees.” He should also meditate on the alluring beauty of the Lord of which (the Alvar) says &ldquo;The eyes that have seen the Lord will refuse to see other things.&rdquo; Having done so, the prapanna should render service suited to the respective relationships between him and the Lord (such as master and servant, father and son) and to His supreme majesty and easy accessibility, in accordance with the following verses :-&ldquo;One should render service to the Lord like a chaste matron to her beloved husband, like a mother to her suckling, like a disciple to his ācārya  and like a friend to his friend. The Lord of Lakṣmī  should always be looked upon as a master, as a friend, as an ācharya, as a father and as a mother&rdquo;, &ldquo;One should serve the Lord with as much fear as one would approach a king who is youthful, and an elephant in rut. In the same way as one would entertain a welcome guest who has come to one&rsquo;s house, one should worship the Lord with devotion, remembering His easy accessibility.” “One should treat the Lord with as much affection as one would a beloved child&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Like Bharatalvan who conducted himself like a servant of a king before (ŚrīRāma&rsquo;s ) sandals and of whom it is said, &ldquo;While the sandals were ruling, Bharata placed, before them first, whatever business had to be transacted and whatever valuable tributes were brought and then accomplished whatever had to be done in the manner in which it should be done&rdquo;, — like him the prapanna should render service as to a king, with materials earned righteously. He should look upon this service as a wedded wife would look upon the careful custody of her sacred wedding - thread and the like. He should have the conviction that he has attained this ultimate aim of life, which begins from service to Bhagavān and extends up to the service to His devotees, by his relationship with his good ācārya  : for it has been said: &ldquo;Kshatrabandhu, the great sinner, and Puṇḍarīka the virtuous, both attained mokṣa  by having ācāryas&rdquo; So also has it been said (in Tamil) :- &ldquo;Our ācharyas are like bees which place us at the (flower-like holy feet of the Lord, who is our Master and who renders help to the eternal sūris and &ldquo;If **** Viṣṇu cittar ( Perialvar) who was born in the city of Villipattur and who was perfect in the qualities of the spirit, by some means in his power, make the Lord appear before us, we can see&rdquo; (That is to say - without the grace of Viṣṇucitta, the ācharya, they cannot do anything themselves). The prapanna should feel grateful at the thought of the expansion of knowledge which the ācāryas have wrought in him and of such things as the service (of the Lord and His devotees) which have resulted from it. He should behave towards them as towards the servants (of the palace) who light the lamps and keep them burning on the night before the coronation of the prince (as a token of their rejoicing). He should feel grateful also to the Lord at the thought of His innate compassion which is the common and primary cause of all these and which, in the state of mukti, removes the dreaded possibility of a break in the enjoyment of Bhagavān whose independent will cannot be questioned. For it has been said:&ndash; &ldquo;The Lord **** makes us climb up to Vaikuṇṭha   through the centre of the sphere of the sun whose rays dispel darkness and He removes the ladder that helped to climb, so that there may be no coming back&rdquo;, and again, &ldquo;If one goes to Vaikuṇṭha   after performing prapatti by uttering the words &lsquo;Namo Narana&rsquo;, He will not let one come back to the world of saṁsāra, even if one should furnish security for going back to Vaikuṇṭha  &ldquo;. (Nammalvar) says: &ldquo;The firm feet of Nārāyaṇa whose praise is unsurpassed&rdquo; (the feet being firm, those who have caught hold of them can never slip down); and again &ldquo;Bhagavān&rdquo; is our Father who takes away from His devotees their future births, leads them to Vaikuṇṭha, helps the manifestation of their svarūpa or essential nature and sees to their ever remaining under His feet even like the lines on the soles (of His feet)&rdquo;, and further, &ldquo;The Lord looks after (our) welfare by taking us to His feet and by preventing our fall therefrom&rdquo;. The prapanna should feel grateful to the Lord of Lakṣmī , the śeṣī, whose will is ever absolute and who, even after mokṣa , shows the same compassion as during saṁsāra. (The Alvar describes this compassion in the following words);- &ldquo;By Thy grace and the grace of Thy Spouse who lives in the lotus, I served at Thy temple of old&rdquo;</p>
<p>WHAT THE PRAPANNA SHOULD DO WITH HIS MIND,</p>
<p>HIS SPEECH AND HIS BODY:</p>
<p>About this code of conduct (of the prapanna) we will now state what is considered as the essence in regard to what should be avoided by the three senses viz the mind, the speech and the body and also in regard to what should be observed or followed by them: &ldquo;Between poison (Visha) and the objects of sense (Vishaya) there is a great gulf of difference, for poison kills only the man who eats it, whereas objects of sense kill even at their mere thought.&rdquo; It has been said also, &ldquo;Is it fair on Thy part to delude my soul by showing before sinful me the various pleasures by which the senses allure me to my suffering ?&rdquo; Therefore in order that the desire for the ultimate object of life may not languish, the most important among those that should be forgotten is the enjoyment of sense pleasures. In order that one may not become ungrateful, the chief thing that should be thought of is the assistance given to us by the ācārya  from the time his glance first fell on us. In order that we may not lose the sense of helplessness, the chief thing that should be avoided in speech is the expression of our excellence. In order that one may not forget one&rsquo;s conviction in the upāya, the chief among the things that should be uttered is Dvaya; (the Bhāṣyakāra says) “one should ever utter the Dvaya with an understanding of its meaning &ldquo;. In order that Bhagavān who is entitled to receive our service with pleasure may not become displeased at heart, the most important among those that should be avoided by all the three senses is offence to those that know Brahman; as Andal says, “ We will never do what ought not to be done&rdquo;. In order that the sea of our supreme aim in life may not dry up or become shallow, the most important among those things that should be done is service to the ācārya  and other devotees of Bhagavān as ordained in the śāstras and forming the outer limit of the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>This code of conduct which should be followed after prapatti and which is an end in itself should be considered in those parts of the three mysteries (mantras ) which indicate the benefit or fruit that results.</p>
