<p>The Lord merges the aggregate of the senses in the mind, the mind with the senses in the vital breath (prāṇa), the vital breath with these in the self or soul, the self in the subtle elements (Sakṣina bhutas ) and the self with these elements in Himself (the Supreme Self) very soon. So far, the process of the soul&rsquo;s departure is common to both the person who has realised Him and the person who has not realised Him. Thereafter, the Lord leads the self through different veins ( nadi)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> which lead either to the (dark) path of smoke or to the shining path of light (archirādi) or elsewhere in accordance with the qualifications (of each individual).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having given up all upāyas, and having given up also all desires including the desire to enjoy one&rsquo;s self, I seek as my refuge, O, Lord, Thy feet which measured the world.&rdquo; When with these words, the prapanna takes the feet of the Lord, the Lord takes him by the hand, which, it has been said, is the only support of the prapanna: &ldquo;The hands of the Lord who is called Janārdana and who has been bought with the price of bhakti is the only support for the prapanna.&rdquo; The Lord who has been called &ldquo;the king of kings of all (beings)&rdquo; and who is the possessor of the two glories, Līlā Vibhūti (in this world) and Nitya Vibhūti or eternal glory in Paramapada, (having taken him by the hand) fixes him in a place of His own liking and the prapanna leads his life there, being held in as high a regard as an anointed queen and following such occupations as are consistent with his exclusive and supreme attachment to the Lord.</p>
<p>DELAY IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THE GOAL :</p>
<p>Among prapannas, there may be (some ) who, on account of certain specific evil deeds done in past lives which have begun to operate now, may become subject to such lapses as the following :- (1) They may display the feelings of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine&rsquo; (ahankāra and mamakara) (2) as a result of these (feelings) they may commit offences; (3) they may display a taste or desire for other objects than the Lord; (4) owing to this desire they may contact other deities; (5) they may be weak-minded; owing to this (weak-mindedness ), they may desire to adopt other upāyas. There may be others who, owing to good deeds done in past lives which have begun to yield their fruits in this life and owing to the specific nature of the request for benefits made at the time of prapatti, have never swerved from the service of the Lord. It may be asked what is the nature of the delay in the release from saṁsāra in the case of these two classes of prapannas. The answer is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In this matter, prapaninas will never have the feelings of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine&rsquo; in any deep-seated form such as the Cārvākas (materialists) have. Even people who walk warily sometimes stumble; so also prapannas may, on rare occasions, show these feelings; but these improper feelings or notions will disappear by later wisdom originating in reason.</p>
<p>(2) In the chapter on the atonement for offences, we explained how, if offences are committed, they will last only until the time of winning pardon or the undergoing of punishment and how the offences will be expiated within the required time.</p>
<p>In the case of those who performed prapatti without indicating any definite time (for the attainment of mokṣa ), it is said as follows: &ldquo;The man who has performed prapatti to me and who has not abstained from sins committed frequently, attains me late after wearing out all his sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(3) &ldquo;Since the prapanna is bent on attaining mokṣa, he is not likely to have any long-standing desire for other benefits. Like those who have both Brahma bhāvana and Karma bhavana, (Brahma, Rudra and the like), they might entertain a desire for other benefits along with the desire for mokṣa ; if so, Iśvara, who is their well-wisher, will not grant them those (so called) benefits ( as they are not for his good); for it is said :-&ldquo;Even when the bhakta prays for it, Iśvara does not permit him to do what is not good to himself. Does not the mother prevent her child that longs to fall into the fire ?&rdquo; It is said also :&ndash; &quot; He whom I want to bless &ndash; his wealth I take away from him. His relations will then desert him. He will become miserable. If, in his misery, he still clings to me, I confer on him such blessings as are unattainable even for the devas.&rdquo; The same idea is found in the story of Kundadhāra<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> . Sometimes Iśvara creates in the prapanna a distaste for these other things by making him realise that they are trivial, transient and mingled with pain. Sometimes, as in the case of Soubhari and Kuchela, he gives them the benefits desired by them, but makes them feel an aversion to them afterwards.</p>
<p>Thus the man who performed prapatti indicating the time when he should attain mokṣa , will have acquired an aversion to other benefits than the Lord within the prescribed time. In the case also of the man who did not indicate any such time while performing prapatti, there will be delay, as has been stated in the śloka : - &ldquo;The man who is desirous of performing such karma as is a means of obtaining other benefits (than God ) enjoys pleasures unmingled with pain, and at last acquires a distaste for them (and the spirit of renunciation ), after which he reaches the abode of Bhagavān. In accordance with this, the delay in his attainment (of the supreme goal) will be only until the birth of aversion to worldly objects.</p>
<p>(4) In regard to contact with other deities, the Ruler of All will bring him back some day or other into the company of those who are staunchly and exclusively devoted to Bhagavān, correct his lapse until he gets ashamed and thus remove his deviation from the right path.</p>
<p>If, in some, this contact with other deities becomes permanent, it may be inferred that the adoption of prapatti as an upāya was incomplete in their case. It may also be understood that they may have such things as Naraka in future. In a man of this description, the fragmentary prapatti performed to Bhagavān may, at some time in the future, attain completion and become effective.</p>
<p>(5) In those who performed prapatti after the rise of full and great faith, there will not be any weak-mindedness nor the desire to adopt other upāyas. If these - viz., weak-mindedness and the desire to adopt other means &ndash; are present, it is to be inferred that their former faith was not strong enough. The Lord of All will correct these men also until they acquire great faith and make them perfect prapannas.</p>
<p>In the case of those in whom no such lapses occur, there is no possibility at all of delay in the attainment (of the supreme goal). There will be delay for them only as long as they desire it. They will attain mokṣa  at the time when they desire to have it. The Adhikarī who has attained the true state of a prapanna will always be the favourite of the Supreme Ruler, who is the Lord of Lakṣmī , as pointed out in the passage. &ldquo;O, Thou, Lord of Śrīraṅgam, that delightest in those idle* men (prapannas ) who stand outer-most (as being incapable of karma yoga, jñāna yoga or bhakti yoga )&rdquo;. [ They are called &lsquo;idle&rsquo;, because, after prapatti they do not seek any other upāya. They are said to stand &ldquo;outer-most&rdquo; because, being unable to adopt karma yoga, jñāna yoga and bhakti yoga, they have adopted the upāya (prapatti) which is prescribed in the Carama śloka  of the Gita.]</p>
<p>In the case of this prapanna, the Lord who is the unconditional śeṣī  of all, who is independent of all others and without limitations of any kind and whose will is irresistible, withholds his desire to punish, which is the cause of all fears, at the very first moment in which he utters the sentence expressing prapatti, in the same way as at the beginning of the meditation in the case of the upāsaka or bhakti yoga niṣṭhā, who has adopted prapatti as a means to bhakti, of whom it is said. &quot; When the vidyā commences, the destruction of former sins and the absence of contact with subsequent sins (occur), for so the śrutis say&rdquo;. The Lord makes up His mind (at that very instant) to bring him and those who are his followers into the company of the eternal sūris and, not satisfied with having done only this, He devours, as it were, all the heaps of sins committed by those who have sought Him and does not reveal any trace of them outside and feels also that He should stomach even more (of these sins). He removes the sins of his followers too, even when they are committed deliberately, by His will to grant the prapanna His blessing. In virtue of this, they will expiate their sins by repentance and the like. It is said: &ldquo;He (the Lord) hastens to give Paramapada to the man who is fit for mukti&rdquo;. The Lord pities the prapanna for the delay which he has chosen and hastens to create in him an impatience of delay (in attainment). He produces in him an eagerness to attain the goal as illustrated in the following (verses ) :- “ Hereafter I do not want to be born in this world of ignorance&quot; and &ldquo;Do not deceive me as Thou didst before. I swear by Thee and by Thy queen whose beautiful locks of hair shed their fragrance like a garland on Thy chest - I swear that I must be taken to Paramapada.&rdquo; Having made him so eager and so impatient to obtain the goal, the Lord decides on giving him Paramapada as desired by him at the end of this life, which has come to him as a result of past karma: So has it been said :-&ldquo;Our Lord&rdquo; is the greatest benefactor that confers Vaikuṇṭha   on those who have performed prapatti, when they happen to die&quot;. The Lord* has already seen to it that the fetters of gold and iron which bind him to saṁsāra namely, his pāpa and puṇya, past and future, as also the karma which has begun to operate, except that portion of it which he has agreed to expiate (during this life) are cut off without any trace being left at all. [ Even puṇya karma which would lead to swarga is a fetter (though of gold ), because it stands in the way of mokṣa.] It is said :- &ldquo;The sins of the past and the sins committed after prapatti vanish like cotton thrown in the fire.&rdquo; So when the time for leaving the body has come, the Lord causes his meritorious deeds (puṇya) and his sins (papa) to be divided and distributed among others, namely, those who were his well-wishers and those who did evil to him, respectively, as the consequence of the good and the evil wrougbt to him by them. For it has been said:&ndash; &ldquo;The man who is about to attain mukti leaves his puṇya and pāpa to his friends and foes respectively and attains Brahman as the fruit of bhakti yoga&rdquo;. and again &ldquo;The sins which are notorious in this world and which, oppressive like Yama, make a man sink into saṁsāra left the man about to attain mukti without making the least noise and entered into plants (viz, his foes )&rdquo;. The authors of the Smṛtis have expressed the truth contained in the Upaniṣads in the manner stated above.</p>
<p>THE PRAPANNA MAY DIE AT ANY TIME, DAY OR NIGHT, IN THE BRIGHT OR IN THE DARK HALF OF THE MONTH : ETC.</p>
<p>In regard to those who are desirous of other benefits than mokṣa  and who have not fulfilled completely the means of attaining mokṣa , it has been said in the Smṛti, and in the science of the celestial bodies, in the context of the departure from the body that Day-time, the bright half of the month (Sukla pakṣa) and the Uttarāyaṇa are favourable times for those that die. But (as the prapanna has adopted successfully the proper upāya) there is no such rule for him in regard to the time of death. For it has been said about him ;-&ldquo;It is not right to say that the man who dies at night will not attain mokṣa , for the association with karma lasts only as long as the body lasts &ldquo;, and again &quot; For the same reason, the views is not right that the man who dies in dakṣmayana will not attain mokṣa .&rdquo; Whether in the day of man or in the night of man, whether in the day of pitṛs (s&rsquo;ukla pakṣa ) or in the night of the pitṛs (Kṛṣṇapakṣa ), whether in the day of the gods (uttarāyana ) or in the night of the gods (dakṣmayana ) - at the time appointed by the Lord, He makes him remember all his previous thoughts and desires (for mokṣa ) and like a king who is gracious and who cuts off the fetters of the prince lying in the prison-house, the Lord takes him along with Him. He causes some occasion or other suited to the time, for the soul&rsquo;s parting from the body without regard to auspicious or inauspicious time.</p>
<p>THE PROCESS OF THE SELF LEAVING THE BODY:</p>
<p>Then the Lord makes the ten external senses like speech merge in the mind and the mind with the senses of action and of knowledge, which are thus eleven in number, merge in the vital breath (prāṇa) and the vital breath in the self. Then at the moment of the shaking of the bone in the back called vamsa, the Lord churns out the subtle elements from the gross body (sthūla deha) and contacts the self with the subtle elements (sūkṣma bhuta) and then comforts the self so mingled with the senses, the vital breath and the subtle elements by keeping it by the side of Himself in the form that He has assumed in the heart; for, by nature, He is its friend and well-wisher. After giving the self, rest and relaxation, the Lord sees that the self passes out of the body. So far, the process is the same both for the man who has realised Brahman and for the man who has not.</p>
<p>THE PATH OF THE JOURNEY AFTER DEPARTURE:</p>
<p>(In regard to this passage of the self from the body), it has been said as follows: &ldquo;The Jīva   who abides in the heart like a lamp has innumerable veins (nādi). They are of many colours:&mdash; white, black, violet, blue, golden yellow, yellow and red. Among these veids (1ādīs), which are of varied colours, there is one which proceeds upwards. The individual self (Jīva  ) who passes through this vein breaks through the sphere of the sun and, having passed beyond the world of Brahma, reaches the highest state. One hundred other nādīs also go upwards. The Jīva   who goes out through them attains the bodies of the devas and reaches their worlds. Some nādis of various colours go downwards and they are dim. The Jīva   who goes out through them is born in saṁsāra in this world, without any choice on his part, in order to experience the fruits of his karma. (Since the nādīs are like rays proceeding from the heart which is like a lamp, they are called rays (rasmis).</p>
<p>The Lord sees to it that the self of the prapanna does not go out through any of these nādīs which lead those that are thieves of themselves, ((i. e.) who do not realise that they belong to the lord) to svarga and naraka (hell) and are therefore like the routes along which thieves take their victims. He makes the prapanna&rsquo;s self enter the Brahma Nīdi, which is beyond the hundredth among those nādīs that go upwards and which leads to the shining path called arcirādi, and helps it to start with the support of the rays of the sun.</p>
<p>When Kooratth alvan (ŚrīVatsankamiśra) was in his last moments, his tongue was parched with the fatigue (of the moment) and (unable to speak or utter any words) he caught hold of Śrī Rāmānuja&rsquo;s feet. At that time Śrī Rāmānuja whispered the Dvaya Mantra in his ear<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> . The other disciples, who were there, said to themselves with mental depression :- &ldquo;How can we hope to get this blessing ( Dvaya being whispered in the ear by ŚrīRāmānuja)? What shall we do?&rdquo; Śrī Rāmānuja understood their fears and said, &ldquo;Do you not know the true character of Alvan? When he is in this condition (unable to say anything owing to the parched throat), what I did was only like placing a little camphor and a piece of sugar-candy (in his mouth, to make it wet). I did not whisper the Dvaya in order to make the upāya complete with its accessories&rdquo;. The disciples were relieved on hearing this.</p>
<p>Therefore as has been said in the following two ślokas: &quot; The man who has performed prapatti, whether he dies in a holy place or in the house of one who eats dog&rsquo;s flesh, will attain mokṣa  even if he dies unconscious,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;The man who, when his mind is in its normal condition, when the body is not shattered, and when the elementary constituents of the body (dhatu) are in perfect equipoise, meditates on me who have the world as my body and who am not subject to births due to karma when  man lies like a log of wood or a piece of stone in his dying moments, I think of (him) my devotee and lead him to attain the highest state&rdquo;, and as has been stated also in the Tamil verses , &ndash; &ldquo;O, Lord that reposest on Adi Śeṣa in Śrīraṅgam, a man seeks refuge under the strong in order that he may obtain their support when he is in distress; though I am not like Tby devotees who know how to seek Thy help, yet I approach Thee, since Thou wert gracious even to the elephant; when the langour of the dying moment has come, I may not be able to think of Thee. Therefore I entreat Thee, even now, that, at that time, Thou shouldst come to my rescue,&rdquo; &ndash; as has been said in these passages, the prapanna need not seek the remembrance (of God) in his last moments (by any effort of his own ).</p>
<p>THE LAST THOUGHT :</p>
<p>The statement:-&ldquo;At the time of casting the body away, you will be in full possession of your intelligence owing to my grace; you will have a vision of me and will have all your previous memories and desires (for mokṣa  )&rdquo; &ndash; this statement, too, has to be interpreted in a manner that would not be in conflict with the verses cited above. This is how it should be interpreted. Some ācāryas interpret as follows:-&ldquo;The statement made in (Śaraṇāgati Gadya) applies to those prapannas who, while performing prapatti, begged also for the remembrance of the Lord) in their last moments.&rdquo; This interpretation cannot be accepted for the following reason :There must be some-last thought or other at the time of casting off the body and this thought must have some object or other. If the object that is thought of were other than the Lord, it would become dangerous, for it has been said. &quot; Whatever object one thinks of at the time when one leaves one&rsquo;s body &ndash; that alone will one attain (after death)&rdquo;, So we have to conclude that) if the man has performed prapatti as an independent means (whether or not he begged for the remembrance (of the Lord) in his last moments while performing prapatti, he will get that remembrance as stated in the Gadya. This is the interpretation favoured by someācāryas. In the verses from Sanskrit and Tamil quoted above (where the last remembrance is not declared to be necessary), what is meant is that the last remembrance is not prescribed for the prapanna as something to be effected by his own effort as an upāya. In the eighth chapter of the Gitā, and in the śloka  which says :-&ldquo;That Bhagavān whom the yogis keep in their minds by an effort at the time of leaving the body-keeping that Bhagavān in mind, Bhīṣma gave up his body. Was he not one who attained the fruit of his bhakti or upāsana ?&rdquo; (The last remembrance comes as an upāya for those who adopt bhakti as the means and it comes by their own effort); but in the case of the prapanna, the remembrance comes out of the Lord&rsquo;s grace alone. &quot; Kevalam madiya dayaya&quot; are Śrī Rāmānuja&rsquo;s words. What does this last remembrance mean? When speech and other activities have be come impossible, the remembrance or thought which arises in the mind before the mind, too, ceases to function-this is the last remembrance. Those who stand by cannot know it. Śrī Rāmānuja&rsquo;s commentary on the Brahma Sūtra: “It is seen  that the mind functions even after the senses have ceased to do so&quot;, means only this, that the mind&rsquo;s functioning may be inferred by some sign or other. It may also describe his own experience in some states of ill-health and the like. Therefore this last remembrance is a thing that could be known only to the man who becomes a mukta and to (the Lord) who gives him mokṣa .</p>
<p>After this, the self, whether it be of the yogi or of one who is not a yogi, takes repose by the side of the Supreme Being who is in his heart (Harda) and is in a state similar to that of dreamless sleep (suṣupti).</p>
<p>It may be asked whether the description contained in the slokās and Tamil verses quoted above (Nos. 20 and 21)-such as being like a log of wood or like a piece of stone, and loss of all remembrance or consciousness may not be a reference to this state of suṣupti. The answer is that if so, there would be no special consideration for the prapanna ( which certainly there is).</p>
<p>Thereafter (i.e. after repose by the side of the Supreme Being), the self or soul attains perfect knowledge being awakened by the Lord (who is wise) and who says that &ldquo;the Jīva   gets knowledge, memory and forgetfulness only from Him. Lighted by that knowledge, it enters into the Brahma Nadi. Thence  forward Time is one eternal day for the self.</p>
