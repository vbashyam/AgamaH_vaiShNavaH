<p>The essential nature (svarūpa) of the Omnipresent Lord (vibhu), what and of what description are His qualities, His vibhavas (avatārs), His sportful activities and the like and the limits set by His command &ndash; all these can be determined from the śrutis. So also the greatness of His devotees and the potency of the ways in which we should worship Him (bhakti) and the like (prapatti) have been determined by great men like Śrī Rāmānuja in accordance with what is stated (in the sūtras).</p>
<p>We have so far shown the manner in which the misconceptions that arise in regard to the Siddhopāya which is revealed by the words in the second or accusative case in Dvaya (Śrīman Nārāyaṇa caraṇau) and Saranam and the specific Sādhyopāya (prapatti) mentioned in the predicate (prapadye) can be removed. It now remains to clear those misconceptions that may arise about the potency of the upāya - misconceptions assigning to it a greater or less potency than that warranted by the pramāṇas (sources of true knowledge ).</p>
<p>THE GREATNESS OF THE DEVOTEES OF</p>
<p>BHAGAVĀN:</p>
<p>Those who have adopted these upāyas are, indeed, described as having the greatness of being capable of securing redemption even to those who are connected with them. It is said: “Their &lsquo;fathers and their grand-fathers dance in joy clapping (their hands) saying: “A devotee of Viṣṇu is born into our family and he will help to save us from saṁsāra &quot; and again, &quot; Those seven&rsquo; generations of men who were born before into my family and those seven generations who will be born after me have become the servants of the Lord. We have obtained this glorious and great existence&quot;. Similarly it has indeed been stated that the greatness of the man who has a knowledge of Bhagavān cannot be (adequately) estimated by the gods even &ldquo;: &ldquo;Even the gods cannot measure the greatness of the man who knows Śrī Kṛṣṇa as He is &ldquo;. However we will now state the limits (of this greatness) so far as caste is concerned, by the force of pramāṇas which are not opposed to these texts (quoted above).</p>
<p>DOES PRAPATTI ENTITLE A ŚŪDRA TO BE</p>
<p>CONSIDERED A BRAHMIN</p>
<p>It is said: “Those Sūdras&rdquo; who have devotion&rsquo; (bhakti ) to Bhagavān are not Śūdras; they who are devotees of Bhagavān are Brahmins. Those who have no bhakti to Bhagavān (Janārdana), whatever might be their caste - they alone are sūdras&rdquo;. Thus by the presence or absence in them of the specific attribute of bhakti to Bhagavān, men of lower castes are called by the names of the higher and men of higher castes are called by the names of the lower respectively. From this, men of poor understanding might ask, “Are not the devotees of Bhagavān of one and the same caste?&rdquo; If this view were accepted, it would be in conflict with all the śāstras that prescribe the respective course of right conduct stating, &ldquo;Thus will the devotee of the Lord who is a Brahmin conduct himself and thus will the devotee who is a Śūdra conduct himself.&rdquo; The distance that exists between the mere Brahmin and the mere Śūdra should be considered to exist (also) between the Lord&rsquo;s devotee who is a Brahmin and the Lord&rsquo;s devotee who is a Śūdra. The śāstras which state that they are equal refer only to such things as the attainment of the final goal (mokṣa). Kadambi Appullar has made this point clear. Further learned scholars (like Peria Achan Pillai) while commenting on the verse, &ldquo;The name, Nārāyaṇa confers a (higher) kulam&rdquo;, express the following conclusion:- &ldquo;If a man who is low by birth and by conduct attains contact with Bhagavān, one who has them both should shrink from calling him low, because of the potency of his devotion to Bhagavān&rdquo;. In answer to the question . “But this does not mean intermarriage among them &ldquo;, they declared that this (prohibition of inter-marriage) is due to caste and that the praise of the man is due to his possession of virtues. The words, &quot; It confers a higher kulan&rdquo;, and likewise, the passage - “ We will give up our former kulam, and sing the praise of Bhagavān &quot; mean only exaltation in the Vaiṣṇava kulam. His kulam is indeed such as will not entertain the worship of other deities as well as the Lord. The saying current in the families of those who are exclusively devoted to Bhagavān (ekantī) is indeed as follows : &ldquo;He to &lsquo;whom Vāsudeva is not the (sole) deity from birth to death let him not be born into our family and even if he is born, let him die soon.&rdquo; Though the kulam is changed, since the words caste and kulam have been used in different senses, we may say that the caste will remain the same, but that the kulam will be different. &quot; Though the cow may be of the temple, it does not cease to be a cow&quot;. In such passages as this:-&ldquo;He should be considered as a Śūdra&rdquo;, the great sages called men of higher castes by the words applicable to the lower castes and vice versa merely to indicate the degree of consideration or respect to be shown. Therefore the purport of the śāstra is only this much:“Brahmins who are not devotees of Bhagavān are not to be held in esteem, whereas Śūdras who are devotees of Bhagavān should be as much esteemed as Brahmins.&quot;</p>
<p>If this were not accepted (as the right interpretation), all rules and regulations (regarding caste) would be set at naught on the strength of the censure and praise (which) alone are intended to be conveyed) in such passages as the following :- &ldquo;Auspicious qualities which carry esteem do not arise from caste. The gods consider as a Brahmin even a caṇḍāla who conducts himself in accordance with his caste,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sannyasins and those who perform tapas (austerities) become caṇḍālas when they lapse from the code of conduct prescribed for them&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Because&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s hair has turned grey, he is not esteemed as old. He who has jñāna, even if he be a child, is esteemed by the gods as an old man&quot;. This is the right explanation of all such passages :</p>

</details>
<p>When a member of one caste is praised as being of another Caste, it is to state that he should be esteemed as such at heart. But social conduct is regulated by special rules governing it.</p>
<p>Śrī Vidura, too, performed marriages and the like in accordance with the rules of his caste. “After the best of the Brahmins had eaten, Śrī Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;&rsquo; sat on a high seat and ate the pure and delicious food offered by Vidura.” On bearing of this, Duryodhana said to Śrī Kṛṣṇa:-&ldquo;Without coming to Bhīṣma, Droṇa or to me, O Thou of lotus eyes, why didst thou eat, O Madhusūdana, in the house of a Śūdra?&rdquo; Śrī Kṛṣṇa replied, “The food&quot; offered by an enemy should not be eaten. (So also ) an enemy should not be given food to eat. You hate the Pandavas, O king. Are they not my very life?&quot; In answering thus, it is evident that Śrī Kṛṣṇa admitted the truth of the particular caste ascribed to Vidura by Duryodhana.</p>
<p>It may be asked: &ldquo;Is not the eating of food cooked by a Śūdra forbidden to Brahmins and Kṣatriyas ?&rdquo; The answer is as follows: &ldquo;Apastamba and others state that Śūdras who are under the supervision of Aryas are competent to cook their food&rdquo;, In other yugas (than Kali) there was no prohibition, because good Śūdras under the control of Aryas were permitted to cook the food of the Aryas. (We read) further :&ndash; &ldquo;The pure Vidura, having the qualities necessary for it, brought the food.&rdquo; testifies to it, as Vidura&rsquo;s exceptional qualities are referred to.</p>
<p>When this Brahma Jnani (Vidura) gave up his life by the power of yoga, Dharmaputra (it is true) felt it his duty (as his nephew) to perform his funeral obsequies in the special form (of Brahmamedha ). But it may have been performed in silence (without mantras;) or it was justifiable in the case of that exceptional individual. This should not be considered as a precedent in the case of other individuals (as a principle applicable to all). If (this answer) were not accepted, it would follow that, because the virtuous Pandavas had a common wife, owing to the force of certain exceptional circumstances, others, too, might do likewise. (This would lead to promiscuity in social relations ). Therefore each individual should stand firm in his caste and render service (kaiṅkarya) to Bhagavān in accordance with what is prescribed as competent for that caste. .</p>
<p>Those who abide by the śāstras should not believe in the elevation from (lower) castes stated in the deceptive śāstras (of heretics ). The case of such as Visvamitra (who became a Brahmin after being a Kṣatriya, was due to certain special causes as the charu (oblation of grain cooked in milk and other things) eaten by his mother without knowing that it was intended for pro ducing a Brahmin child - it should not be considered that it is applicable to others as well, for it is against the texts (in the s&rsquo;astras). The incidents and conduct of the Alvars who were possessed of powers even superior to those of Vidura and others should not be taken as precedents for our conduct. If we examine even their cond.ict carefully, (we shall find) that they did not transgress the rules of their respective castes.</p>
<p>The śloka :-&ldquo;Viṣṇu&rdquo; is always to be praised (in song) with true knowledge (jñāna). Therefore the pure knowledge concerning the eternal Lord should be obtained in clearness either from Brahmins or from Kṣatriyas or from Vaiśyas or from Śūdras or from even lower castes - this śloka means merely that since knowledge of Bhagavān is essential as an acquisition, mere knowledge in its clearness should be obtained, when men of the previous castes are not available, even from those that are below them. Notwithstanding this, the initiation into vidyās (upāsanas), mantras and the like should be only from such as Brahmins. This is clearly established from Vidura&rsquo;s words:-&ldquo;As I was born a Śūdra, I cannot teach any further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tuladhara and Dharmavyadha (who were of lower castes) only did this much: they treated with respect the Brahmins who came to them to have their doubts cleared regarding dharma and made them understand the points at issue, just like people who put pilgrims on the right path when they happen to have lost their way. They did not become the main ācāryas (of the Brahmins). This is how the incidents in the Itihasas should be understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bhakti or devotion is of eight kinds. If this bhakti is found in a mleccha, he should be considered as a devout and knowing Brahmin. To him giving is proper and from him taking is proper. He should be treated with the same reverence as I myself&rdquo;. This śloka has been commented upon (by Peria Achan Pillai) As meaning not that girls might be given in marriage to him and the like, but that he may be given the gift of knowledge and such like. &ldquo;Treatment with reverence&rdquo; (poojyah) is a general term. Therefore it means that if a man has devotion to Bhagavān, he should be treated with as much respect as the śāstras permit. Its purport is merely this much, that if a man treats such a devotee in the same way as he would treat others of the same caste, he would go to hell. The great sage summarised this in the śloka “He who treats a devotee of Bhagavān, be he a Śūdra, a huntsman, or even a man who eats dog&rsquo;s flesh, as he would treat other men of these castes - he would go to hell.&quot; Therefore the potency of devotion to Bhagavān should be so estimated as not to infringe the regulations of caste.</p>

<p>Therefore the contention that all devotees of Viṣṇu are of the same caste either because of the lower caste perishing or of all castes perishing&ndash;this contention is foolish. Reverence for the sake of devotion to Bhagavān is common, according to the sages, to all. Equality by the destruction of castes and the like will occur (only) at the time of mukti.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavadgītā and elsewhere, in such passages as the following, the regulations and limits of the respective castes and regulations of conduct in accordance with castes have been declared in unequivocal terms, even in the case of men who have devotion to Bhagavān:-&ldquo;Women,&rdquo; Vaiśyas and Śūdras, even among these, whoever seek me as refuge will attain the highest state&quot;. &ldquo;The man who is absorbed in the performance of the duties and rites pertaining to his caste will attain the supreme end of life. Learn from me how this happens. The man attains his end by worshipping Bhagavān with the performance of his ordained karma&rdquo;; &ldquo;Therefore the Śūdra should not utter my names with the praṇava (aum)&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bhagavān who is the Supreme Person is adored by the man who performs the duties and rites of his varṇa and his āśrama. There is nothing which delights Bhagavān other than this&rdquo;. &ldquo;The man who does not deviate in the least from the karmas ordained for his caste, who considers alike those who wish him well and those who wish him ill, and who never deprives another of what belongs to him and never does any action of violence (himsā) - know that this man who has a mind free from faults like desire is a devotee of Viṣṇu&rdquo;. Thus the virtue of being a devotee of Bhagavān and the specific fruit which will result from it (mukti) are common, whereas diversity of castes and diversity of codes of conduct persist (uptil mukti). This is evident from such passages as this.&quot; The Śūdra is ( really) &ldquo;fortunate and Kaliyuga is (really ) fortunate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>SATTVAM OF THE BODY AND SATTVAM OF THE MIND.</p>
<p>It has been said, &ldquo;Tamas&rdquo; (ignorance, sloth etc., ) is found in great measure in the Śūdra, rajas in the Kṣatriya and sattvam in the Brahmin&quot;. Owing to the preponderance of such qualities as sattvam, in the body, a man is entitled to be called a Brahmin, a Kṣatriya and the like. But this is different from the praise of being a Brahmin that is often given in certain passages, owing to the quality of sattvam and the like in the mind. The qualities of caste pertaining to the body which are due to the special qualities of the body arise even at the time of birth and remain until death. The Brahmin-like qualities which arise out of the preponderance of sattvam in the mind may be present in all castes. In such as Prahlāda they are present even at the time of birth. In others, owing to such specific causes as contact with āchāryas, these (mental) qualities are acquired (later). Some (texts in the) śāstras are applicable to a person as a consequence of the particular caste pertaining to the body. Owing to the Brahmin-like qualities (of the mind) and the like, the attainment of the supreme end of life and the upāyas therefor and also such things as eulogy may be found in all castes. If in a Brahmin are found such features as are incongruous (with his caste), it will meet with censure that, born in a caste which is declared by the Śāstras as being capable of such virtues as self restraint and mental serenity, he lapsed from the condition suitable to him. If a man born in other castes acquires the higher virtues, he will be extolled bigbly as stated in the śloka :-&ldquo;Men are to be honoured in the following order of preference&ndash;for the possession of vidyā (jñāna), of right karma, of age, of relatives and of wealth. Even a Śūdra possessing these is fit to be honoured in old age&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If the excellence arising from the body and from the qualities of the mind were to cause pride or arrogance, it would lead to evil consequences. If the inferiority in the one (caste due to the body) and in the other (mental virtues) as described respectively in the following passages, &ldquo;I was not born in any of the four castes where dharma could be practised.&rsquo;; and “I was born in a family renowned in the world wherein every one was pure and performed yoga, where every one knew the truth about prakṛti with its three qualities, and the jīvas, where every one had his mind firmly fixed at Thy lotus-like feet and yet I inclined to sin and am now sunk in saṁsāra, O Saviour&rdquo; &ndash; if these two kinds of inferiority are realised by a person and if it should generate in him kārpaṇya (humility) so that he adopts the particular upāya suitable for his ākiñcanya (helplessness), it will be extolled, because it will lead to the attainment of the ultimate end. Thus though there are regulations regarding castes and the code of conduct pertaining to each caste, there is nothing to prevent a person from being honoured in the mind as established above.</p>
<p>EKĀNTINS AND PARAMAIKĀNTINS:</p>
<p>Among those who are devoted to Bhagavān, those who do not bow to any other deity are Ekāntins (i.e.) men with exclusive devotion to Bhagavān, as stated in the śloka :&ndash; &ldquo;Exclusive devotion (Ekāntitvam) to Bhagavān is common to all these three. Exclusive devotion consists in indifference to all other deities and in depending on Him alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among them the man with jñāna is called Paramaikantin or man with supreme and exclusive devotion to Bhagavān, because he does not want anything else and among these latter, the supreme and exclusive devotion of those who, impatient of delay, have performed bharanyāsa to the Almighty śeṣī, and who, understanding the truth of the śruti that those asking for other things are like putting their money to interest, do not ask even for mokṣa as a reward and consider service (kaiṅkarya) as an end in itself (5) &ndash; the supreme and exclusive devotion of these men is like gold which is sixteen points pure.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The great sages who can estimate this degree of purity have described, at considerable length, the greatness of these men with supreme and exclusive devotion to Bhagavān, in such treatises as the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>It is said in the &quot; Vihagendra Saṁhitā&quot; as follows: &ldquo;The man who is always thinking of Nārāyaṇa - whatever be the calling (vritti) he $ ($ another reading is cheshta (i.e.) movement (instead of vritti)) follows for his living, that is adoration; whatever he says (jalpah) is japam; whatever he sees is meditation or dhyāna; the water that has received contact with his feet is incomparably holy water; whatever is left after he has eaten will purify; his mere words are a sacred mantra: whatever he touches becomes pure.&rdquo; These ślokas, it is true, are authoritative, but &ldquo;whatever be the calling, that is adoration&rdquo; does not refer to any calling that is condemned in the śāstras. It means that even if the man is obliged, owing to the unfavourable conditions brought about by place, time and the like, to follow a calling which is not ordained for him, it will be a proper means of obtaining the materials required for the adoration of the Lord, for it has been said: &ldquo;In times of adversity, a man may follow a calling slightly lower than that prescribed for him.&rdquo; The passage which says : - &ldquo;Even the sin committed for my sake will be counted as dharma&rdquo; has also the same purport. If this (interpretation) were not accepted, it would extend even to those callings that are prohibited. Even if the reading (in the śloka cited above) be cheshta ( movement) and not vritti (calling), just like the acts intended for keeping the body alive and those that are enjoined by the śāstra, which are (therefore ) accepted, the word cheshta (movements) would refer to such things as the closing and the opening of the eyes which are natural and which are reckoned in the secret śāstra (i.e.) Bhagavat Śāstra as among <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> the offerings to the Lord. This will not extend to those movements that are forbidden (in the śāstras). Only those which are not forbidden and which are consistent with one&rsquo;s nature and reason and with śāstra are ordained as fit to be offered. This applies also to the śloka in the Gita which elaborates this idea, namely, “ Whatever you do for the protection of the body, whatever you eat, whatever offerings you make in the fire and whatever tapas you perform, do it, O son of Kunti, as if it were an offering to be placed before me.&quot; If, in such cases, any offence is committed against the śāstras, one should perform, on the occasion, expiatory rites which are of the nature of service obligatory for the occasion (naimittika), in accordance with what is competent for one. &ldquo;Whatever he says (jalpah) is japa&rdquo; does not refer to vain chattering such as is forbidden in the śloka : “Harsh speech, exaggeration of merits, tale- bearing, inappropriate talk&ndash; these are the four sins of speech.&quot; It refers to the series of speeches and counter-speeches that are held by the man with his disciples, preceptors, fellow students, scholars and those who are in pursuit of spiritual excellence in order to teach what is not known, to confirm what is already known or to remove doubts. Or the word jalpah in that śloka might mean the succession of speeches that are made in debate to refute infidels and heretics, for, though it is stated as a general rule, &ldquo;One should not debate merely for the sake of a quarrel without the desire to know the truth&rdquo;, yet the dharma - śāstras declare: &ldquo;One should condemn, according to one&rsquo;s ability, those who speak ill of Bhagavān or of one&rsquo;sācārya&rdquo;. &ldquo;Whatever he sees is meditation or dhyāna&rdquo; does not refer to such things as witnessing forbidden dances. It describes how when this man proceeds to render service (kaiṅkarya), whatever object meets his eye appears to him as having Brahman as its inner self, for it has been said, &lsquo;I am Hari: all this is Janārdana; the causal substances like mahat and the effects which are producd therefrom are not different from Him. The man who thinks in this manner &ndash; he will never fall a victim to the diseases of pleasure and pain which arise in saṁsāra&quot;, So also it is said, “Whatever appears ( before his eyes) is the Supreme Self&quot;. The sentence “ T&rsquo;he water that has received contact with his feet is incomparably holy water&quot; only assigns a superior merit when it is due. When the water from the feet is considered as holy, if there is exclusive devotion to Nārāyaṇa in the person, it is said to be holier than other sacred waters. It does not refer to such things as impure water which may, by chance, come into contact with his feet. The statement &ldquo;Whatever is left after he has eaten purifies” refers only to certain specific remnants (of food) (ucchishta) which are prescribed as purificatory in contexts like a repeated Upanayana. Owing to the excellence of this quality, (the remnant of the food) is said to have superior purifying power. The words, certainly, do not mean that when disciples, sons and the like are devoted to Nārāyaṇa, whatever is left as remnant after they have eaten is purificatory for ācāryas and parents. It is said in the Sanatkumāra Saṁhitā that the man who has eaten the food that has been offered to other deities or what is left as a remnant after those who are other than gurus have eaten should, for purification, live on milk alone for a month (payovrata), should always utter ashtākṣara and eat also Brahmakurcha - pañcagavya. This passage prescribes the code of conduct for one who follows the dharma of Bhagavān and has been taken for illustration by Aḷavandār in his Āgama Prāmānya. Therefore the verse - &ldquo;If the *remnant of the food that has been already eaten by the devotees of the Lord is given to me, it will immediately make me pure&rdquo;&mdash; is only applicable to gurus. Even if it is of general application, it means only this much - &ldquo;If those who are devotees of the Lord should give me what is left over after their meal, it would purify me, even though they have been obliged, by force of unfavourable circumstances like place and time, to follow occupations lower than those ordained for them and to make others also follow them.&rdquo; In this (Tamil) passage, if the word śeṣa should mean only what is left in the vessels in which the food was cooked as in the question and answer (after a srāddha) - &ldquo;what is to be done with the food left over ?,&rdquo; and &ldquo;let it be eaten in the company of friends&rdquo; - if it should mean only this, there is nothing wrong. The word ucchishta, too, has been employed in the śrutis to mean what is left in the cooking vessel after (people) have dined. Madu and others have determined to this effect :- &ldquo;One should give up wealth and pleasure (artha and kama) when they are against dharma. Even dharma which is likely to bring suffering or which is likely to rouse disgust among people in the world should be given up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&quot; His very speech should be considered as a sacred mantra &ldquo;. This means that even the words in the vernacular language employed by him as necessary for spiritual elevation should be cherished like Tirumantra and reflected upon. It does not mean that his talk on worldly affairs is fit to be uttered as japa. The saying : &ldquo;His words in jest should be cherished as the texts in the śrutis&rdquo; should also be interpreted in this sense. “All that he touches becomes pure&rsquo;; This should be interpreted as follows:- When a man is ill (and cannot himself bathe ), another is allowed to touch him and bathe for his sake; when the ācārya initiates the śiṣya into the sacred mantras, he touches the śiṣya with his hand; this touch is called &ldquo;touch with the hand of Viṣṇu&rdquo;. When an idol is newly installed, it is touched with the hand by great devotees of the Lord. In certain other circumstances, too, the touch with the hand is prescribed as purificatory. The passage means, therefore, that his touch of all things is even more purificatory in such contexts as are ordained in the śāstras.</p>
<p>If this (interpretation) were not accepted, it would follow that the things which are condemned in the following ślokas would become pure by his touch:-&ldquo;The fruit of the fig tree (attikkai in Tamil) should not be eaten&rdquo;. &ldquo;One&rdquo; should not eat kommatti or (mullaṅgī), athikkāi, suraikkai and kovaippazham. Bhagavān ever stands far away from the man who always eats them.&rdquo; He who eats white brinjals, soap-nut (nettamkottai), kommatti (or mullaṅgī), kuvalai, athikkai, kāndal in ignorance-to him Bhagavān is always at a distance. He who eats, kommatti, sittavarai, kāṇḍal, nilaippanai and suraikkai - to him Bhagavān is ever at a distance.&rdquo; He who eats white brinjals, kommatti, cheese (or curds) made from the milk of a cow within ten days of its calfing, the bulb of the lotus &ndash; he will never think in his last moments of Bhagavān, the Lord of the world, &ldquo;He who has eaten &ldquo;velangãi , peerku, irulli, vellulli, nāikkudai (mushroom) urpanrikkizhangu - he should perform the expiatory ceremony called &lsquo;Chandrāyana&rsquo;. “To eat the sprout of the cocoanut, sanaippukkirai, mushroom, kusumbai, suraikkai, fruits or vegetables that have been produced with nightsoil as manure, milk mixed with salt, ghee that has been poured into the remnants of food on the leaf or plate, water in the place where the dhoby washes clothes to eat these is the same as to drink toddy.&rdquo; &ldquo;The man who thinks of“ Bhagavān should never drink vinegar (kadi). It is reckoned as liquor. Therefore one should earnestly avoid it.&rdquo; &ldquo;The &ldquo;Vaiṣṇava who touches blood even without knowing what it is - I never condone his offence, O goddess of the earth, even after a thousand apologies.&rdquo; &ldquo;He who is born a * Brahmin and eats anna (cooked food) on the Ekādaśī day - he eats sin in every morsel and the morsel is comparable to the dung of the dog &ldquo;.&rdquo; He who is not ill and yet eats anna (cooked food) on the Ekādaśī day-be sins as though he has drunk liquor. There</p>
<p>is no doubt of this. The man who drinks liquor goes to hell by himself, whereas the man who eata anna on Ekādasi day drags his ancestors (also) into hell&rdquo;. &ldquo;The mind becomes impure by eating forbidden food, by coveting what one has not got, by seeing various objects of sense-pleasure and by want of cleanliness in the body&rdquo;. &quot; Yama plans to kill the Brahmin with (the weapons of) failure to study the Vedas, the absence of right observances, laziness and forbidden food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If no such discrimination were accepted, it would conflict with many śāstras which have been recognised as great authorities and also with the traditional observances of the learned (siṣṭa ). Therefore to state such views is merely of the nature of exaggera. tion (of some one aspect). Even by the man who, has supreme and exclusive devotion (paramaikāntin) and whose greatness is boundless, these restrictions imposed by the săstras are not violated. This may be understood from the observances until the last day of their lives, of greatācāryas like Nāthamuni, Aḷavandār and Śrī Rāmānuja.</p>
<p>THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RITES OF THE VARṆAS</p>
<p>AND ĀŚRAMAS IS OBLIGATORY:</p>
<p>Those who are outside the pale of the Vedas and those who hold heretical views give up, owing to delusion, these restrictions and regulations which are ordained in the Vedas and the śāstras based on the Vedas. That this kind of renunciation is due to tamas is declared by Bhagavān in the śloka :- &ldquo;One  should not give up the karma ordained for the castes and the āśramas. Their omission arising from ignorance is renunciation (tyāga) due to tamas&rdquo;. He has (also) declared that the giving up of activities and abstentions which are of the nature of pain is renunciation due to rajas, in the following:- &ldquo;He who gives up karma,because it is painful and fatiguing to the body - he renounces owing to rajas and does not obtain the fruit of renunci ation.&rdquo; His tyāga or renunciation is like that of the man who becomes sannyāsin because of the difficulties of maintaining a family.</p>
<p>While giving up, in accordance with our competence, what should be given ap and doing what should be done, we should give up the thought, &ldquo;I am doing all this as an independent agent, this activity is dependent on me; this will be the means of my attaining such and such an object&rdquo;. We should, on the other hand, think that the Supreme Ruler is the (real) doer and that we render service to Him, which is His due, with the sole object of pleasing Him. If we follow this line of thought (in what we do and in what we refrain from ), it is renunciation due to sattvan, and this has been declared by Bhagavān in :-&ldquo;To perform the karma ordained for a man with the thought that it is an end in itself and that it ought to be done without the thought that the karma is his (independent) action and without the desire for gain of any kind - this is, O Arjuna, renunciation due to sattvam&rdquo; The man should observe (these rites and regulations ) solely for the purpose of pleasing Bhagavān. He should not even ask for mokṣa as a reward, for he should realise that, by the grace of the All merciful Lord which has been won by the prapatti performed before, mokṣa is certain. (He should) render service (kaiṅkarya) like those who have already attained mukti. This would resemble a healthy man eating food with milk (without any thought of the care from illness to be obtained from milk). Such a code of conduct is the highest limit of renunciation due to sattvam. This is like eating food when men are hungry. Otherwise their conduct would resemble that of men who eat cakes for winning a wager, (They cannot derive any true pleasure therefrom). (The man that eats food when hungry enjoys it, because he does so with no other object than satisfying his hunger. The man who eats cakes for winding a wager, cannot find any relish in doing so.)</p>
<p>THE REAL MEANING OF &ldquo;HAVING GIVEN UP ALL DHARMAS&rdquo;</p>
<p>IN THE CARAMA ŚLOKA:</p>
<p>While commenting on the words (in the Carama Śloka ) “Having given up all dharmas&rdquo;, the author of Śrī Bhāṣya interpreted them at first to mean that the giving up of dharmas means the giving up of the thought that, in his action, the man himself is the doer seeking a certain gain for himself by that means. This is renunciation of action due to sattvam (and not the giving up of the dharma itself  viz., nitya and naimittika). This form of thought should be borne in mind by the man who has adopted prapatti as a direct and independent upāya, at the time of the performance of prapatti and also in his further actions (after prapatti), which are ends in themselves and have no relation of any kind to an upāya. In the second interpretation given of those words (by the author of of the Bhāṣya), they mean that when the man of poor ability who cannot brook any delay in the attainment of mukti falls into grief or despair at the thought of all the dharmas or rites prescribed in the śāstras and his inability to perform them, the Lord, in order to dispel his despair, ordained another means which is easy of perforinance and has to be adopted only once and said: &ldquo;You need not go about seeking other upāyas&rdquo; The prapanna should note that in order that one may be competent for prapatti, the absence of adoption of any other upāya before its performance is a requisite which has been present of its own accord by the grace of God. In regard to actions after the performance of prapatti, this giving up of the adoption of other upāyas is insisted on in the śāstra itself and this shows how prapatti does not require any aid (after it is once done).</p>
<p>If the word parityajya (having given up) merely states what has, on account of inability, already occurred (and not what is enjoined), the meaning (of the first part of the carama śloka) would be that this having given up is a qualification for prapatti. If, on the other hand, the words (having given up) state what is ordained or enjoined to be done, then the meaning would be that prapatti does not require anything else to be performed. Thus, if parityajya (having given up) merely states what has already taken place or what has already occurred, the words mām ekam will have to be thought of as meaning that nothing else (than Bhagavān) is required for the attainment of the desired end. If, on the other hand*<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> parityajya means that prapatti requires nothing else for yielding its fruit, the words, mã suchah (do not grieve), show, by the force of logic or meaning, that the grief or despair which is a mark of being destitute of other means is what is required for competency for praputti (adhikāra;)</p>

<p>If prapatti stands in the place of bhakti or upāsana as one of the Brahma Vidyās, then the question arises whether the aṅgas of bhakti might be considered as the aṅgas of prapatti as well. But, in prapatti, they are not required as aṅgas. This is indicated by the words mām and ekam.</p>
<p>(If the word, parityajya, makes an injunction that other things should not be considered as aṅgas for prapatti, and if the words (māsuchan) (do not grieve or despair) show that the previous grief or despair is qualification for prapatti (ākiñcanya), then, where is the appropriateness of the word ekam (it may be asked ). The answer is :- the word ekam is intended to show that in the mental or sāttvika renunciation of action by sattvam, it should be borne in mind that the jīva&rsquo;s doership is all dependent on the Lord and other such things, that in prapatti, the means (upāya) and the end are one and the same (viz., the Lord) and that prapatti stands in the place of all (other) upāyas.</p>
<p>Our acharyās like (Appallar) have argued thus:</p>
<p>Since nitya and naimittika karma are enjoined on a man (irrespective of all fruit or gain that might arise from it) simply by virtue of his being a servant of the Lord, they should not be given up, lest he should be violating the command of the Master, (although they may not be required as aṅgas for prapatti).</p>

<p>Those who have violated the commands (of the Lord) and have not performed the expiatory ceremonies ( prāyaścitta ) enjoined for these violations according to their competence - they must suffer the consequences of the violation. By acting in accor. dance with the commands, one avoids the evil consequences (due to violation) and enjoys (also) the pleasure arising from the delight of the Lord. Thus two gains are certain.</p>
<p>Such things as svarga that are declared to be the fruit of certain (good) karmas will not arise (as the prapanna performs them without desiring any fruit.) But if the man performs forbidden actions, the evil consequences will necessarily follow (though not desired by him), owing to another cause (viz. doing the forbidden thing).</p>
<p>When prapatti was treated (by the Bhāṣyakāra) as an aṅga of bhakti yoga, it was only to illustrate how it wins bhakti yoga as a fruit, since it is capable of securing all fruits. In this context, we should bear in mind that, on the lines of the Bhāṣyakara&rsquo;s second interpretation (of the carama śloka ), prapatti stands in the place of all upāyas including bhakti yoga, which are difficult of performance. In accordance with his first interpretation, (that every dharma should be done with the thought that it is performed not by oneself but by the Lord and for His own ends - sāttvika parityāga) and not out of any desire for one&rsquo;s own gain, the meaning should be considered as enjoining the performance of prapatti with that thought and the service rendered by the prapanna as an end in itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a man falls into despair or grief because he is not able to adopt certain upāyas which are prescribed as productive of the desired results - to that man I stand as those upāyas. This is the gist of the carama śloka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The performance or the non-performance of certain dharmas (like nitya and naimittika) are not to be considered as aṅgas of prapatti. The man desires to perform these actions of which he is capable, because they have been ordained for him (without any reference to prapatti ). The non-performance of those actions of which he is incapable constitutes ākiñcanya (helplessness) which is necessary for prapatti.</p>
<p>Rites like dars&rsquo;a and purnamāsa have not been prescribed as requisites for yajnas (sacrifices ). So at the time of the performance of yajnas, they are not performed. But on occasions like the new-moon day, they have to be done because they are enjoined on their own account. So also here; (i.e.) nitya and naimittika are not prescribed as aṅgas for prapatti; they are not to be performed at the time of prapatti as its aṅgas, but because they have been enjoined on their own account, without any relation or reference to prapatti.</p>
<p>The teaching &ldquo;Give up dharma and adharma&rdquo; relates to the giving up of those dharmas which are said to be productive of certain gains (kāmya) and of those karmas which are forbidden.&quot; So also &ldquo;give up satyam and also anritam&rdquo; means &ldquo;Do not desire satyam the enjoyment or experience of your self as an end in itself; also do not desire the enjoyment of<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> ] anrita the pleasures of the world, wealth and the like &ldquo;. It may also mean: &ldquo;Give up speaking even that truth (satyam) which will cause pain to</p>
<p>others.&rdquo; In order to reveal the excellence of his teaching, it is repeated again :-&rdquo; Having given up both satyam and anritam&rdquo;, it is said further, &ldquo;Give up the thought which enables you to give up satyam and anritam, namely, the thought that you are the doer&rdquo;, in order to enable us to realise that even our doership is dependent on another (the Lord ). Thus there is no authority here for violating the commands of the Lord.</p>
<p>Now let us consider what was taught to Uddhava :- In spite of what has been said so far, some quote the words addressed to Uddhava.&ndash;&ldquo;Give up, Uddhava, all injunctions (vidhis) (like sandhyā, which are prescribed as a means to an end); give up all prohibitions such as “don&rsquo;t injure others&rdquo;; give up the dharmas to be actively performed and also the dharmas which prescribe the avoidance of or abstention from certain acts and also the requisites (aṅgas) which you have heard so far and which you will learn hereafter as being necessary for both of them (Give up all these) and seek refuge in Me alone by all means, for I am the Inner Self of all beings. By doing so, you will attain mokṣa, where there is freedom from all fear&quot;. They quote these words and argue as follows &ldquo;Since, here we are enjoined<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> to give up the abstention from certain actions, and since in the carama śloka, it is not proper to restrict or limit the meaning of sarva (all) in sarva karmāni, it follows that we should give up even the abstention (from evil acts ).&rdquo; This would mean that we should perform forbidden things as much as lies in our power. Since the doing of these forbidden things is something that, according to them, is enjoined, these people argue in their delusion that even if the prapanna does forbidden things deliberately after prapatti, there would be no stain left. This is extremely ridiculous, for the (notorious) charvakas (alepakas) say that even if a man sins, it leaves no stain behind, whereas the argument stated above goes further and is tantamount to saying that (the prapanna ) should necessarily commit sin: This is &ldquo;like the fish swallowing greedily the bait made of iron covered with something which is delicious to eat, without any thought of the consequence. It is in reflecting on such (perversities) that the great sage became sad: &ldquo;Whatever ** the good man shirks from, that the wicked man is delighted with. How painful is the perversity of this world !&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the interpretation (given by these men) were the real meaning (of the teaching to Uddhava), it would follow that all the forbidden things done by a man throughout his life would be the requisites (aṅgas) of prapatti. The injunction that prapatti with its aṅgas should be done only once would then have no meaning. It is not possible to do all the forbidden things at the moment of performing prapatti. Nor have we seen any one performing prapatti, doing as much of the forbidden as lies in his power. According to this contention of theirs, even sins cannot be called sins (since they are enjoined), in the same way as injury ( to animals) in the Agnishomiya sacrifice is not called a sin ( because it is enjoined). All this would be in conflict with their own commentary on the words &ldquo;I will release thee from all sins&rdquo;, including the sins that might be committed deliberately after prapatti. It would imply that we should commit the three kinds of offences of the wind, speech and body ) as much as lies in our power. It is also opposed to the code of conduct followed by previous ācāryas, to the tradition of our ancients, to their own actual conduct and, further, to the observances of present day aspirants to mukti. Those who contend in this manner should, when they are attacked by a prapanna owing to the desire for wealth or for pleasure, have to say; “Is this not, indeed, the dharma expected of a prapanna ?&rdquo;, and feel delighted. This would be opposed to countless pramāṇas and is also not the real purport of the words in question. Someācāryas would explain this contention that abstention from forbidden things is also included in the words sarva dharman (as something to be given up) is due to ignorance of the meaning of the word dharma. It is in this way: Among abstentions only that which is done in accordance with prescribed rules as a means to secure a particular object is called dharma. Mere non-violence (ahimsā) is only the absence of sin and is not dharma in the primary sense of the word ( for ao rules or restraints are observed). Therefore to give up non-violence undertaken for the sake of an object and in accordance with rules and restraints (niyama) means to give up the object aimed at and the rules and restraints in practising it. Beyond this, there is no au. thority for giving up the abstention from forbidden things that is prescribed in the nivṛtti śāstras (i.e.) śāstras for securing mukti,</p>
<p>Even if it be held that more ahimsā which is not accompanied by niyama (the observance of rules and restraints ) is also meant by the word dharia, we submit the following:</p>

<p>अधर्म परिहारेऽपि धर्मत्वेन विवक्षिते । स्यात्स्वतन्त्रविधेरेव नित्यं तस्य परिग्रहः ॥</p>
</details>
<p>“If the word dharma includes in its import also the giving up of adharma, the giving up of adharma will have to be done always, as it is an independent vidhi or injunction (which has nothing to do with prapatti),</p>
<p>प्रपत्त्यङ्गं प्रतिज्ञातुं न शक्यं साधुसंसदि ॥ प्रपन्नमधिकृत्यैव सदाचारानतिक्रमः ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to contend in an assembly of the wise that the giving up of what is pleasing (to the Lord) anukulya and the performance of what is disagreeable ( to Him) prātikulya are aṅgas to prapatti.</p>
<p>प्रपत्त्यध्यायपठितः प्रतिसन्धीयतामिह ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us bear in mind the fact that the injunction not to violate the code of conduct of the good (such as giving up sandhyā or nitya and naimittika) which we find in the chapter on prapatti is intended to apply only to the prapanna&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When it is thus clear that these should not be given up as they are injunctions which have no relation to prapatti and which are independent rules. it may be asked what is the meaning of the teaching to Uddhava which says &ldquo;Give up what is enjoined for action and also what is forbidden, give up action and abstention from action&rdquo;. The answer is that they mean only this much : that they should not be observed as aṅgas or requisites for prapatti :</p>
<p>In the case of the aspirant for mukti, it may mean also those activities and abstentions which are enjoined as means for securing certain other ends (than mokṣa) in those śāstras that enjoin them, 88 in the passage: &ldquo;Give up those dharmas that are the means of securing dharma, artha and kāma,&rdquo; As against this, if it were held that nitya and naimittika karmas and the like are themselves (svarūpatyāga) to be given up, it would be opposed to everything that has been pointed out before. Those who are intelligent and who are sāttvikas will appreciate this conclusion and approve of it. (The Alvars) have stated this in such passages as the following: &ldquo;We will never do what ought not to be done. We <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> will never go (to any ācārya), and study heretical śāstras&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Vouchsafe Thy grace so that I may not do wicked deeds&rdquo;. If we consider the import of the verse &ldquo;O Lord of the world! Consider my offences as virtuous acts&rdquo;, it also means the prayer that the offences should be pardoned. Therefore if the prapanna happens to commit an offence, he is bound to obtain pardon as declared in the passage :- &quot; Whether &ldquo;offences are committed deliberately or in ignorance, the only expiation that is required is to say &quot; Pardon me &ldquo;.</p>

</details>
<p>&ldquo;He who is incapable of other forms of expiation or who is impatient of delay performs prapatti, once again, to the Lord, without transgressing the rule of lokasaṅgraha&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The contention that when there is aspiration for mukti, no forbidden things will be done deliberately means only that it would be unlikely, being inappropriate. It is like the saying that &ldquo;in the Brahmin there is control of the senses&rdquo;. (It does not mean that the control is always found). Even in the case of great sages</p>
<p>and of men who were sage-like, there have occurred forbidden actions and expiations therefor. If it were otherwise ((1.e) that the aspirant for mukti would never commit an offence deliberately) then, since those who are upāsakas following bhakti yoga are also aspirants for mukti, it would follow that they, too, would not commit offences deliberately and the conclusion that is arrived at in Śrī Bhāṣya that freedom from stain caused by later sins is applicable only to sins committed in ignorance and that there is no pardon for sins committed deliberately - this conclusion would then become meaningless.</p>
<p>There is no difference between the upāsaka (the follower of Bhakti yoga) and the prapanna in regard to what is forbidden on account of caste (varṇa ), āśrama, sex (jāti), gotra (family), pravar, ( ancestry), right conduct, race kula, place, time, bodily or mental condition (avastha), character (guṇa) or convention (samaya). If what is forbidden has been done, there is difference in the manner of expiation, because that depends on the competency (adhikāra).</p>
<p>The verse, &ldquo;My servants will never commit offences. Even if they commit them, I will consider them as if they were virtuous actions&rdquo; - even this verse indicates that offences are not unlikely. The sentence &ldquo;If they commit offences, I will consider them as virtuous actions&rdquo; means “If done in ignorance, I will pardon them. If offences are committed deliberately and if they do not obtain pardon, I will condone them after inflicting punishmeat, but will never forsake them. That, as a matter of fact, these offences are not virtuous acts is indicated therein when it is said: &ldquo;It will be considered as if they were good deeds&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is (distinctly) stated: “If there is an offence, expiation should be done at once. The expiation that is to be done is to perform prapatti again&rdquo;. Therefore it cannot be contended that, if the prapanna commits an offence deliberately after prapatti,</p>
<p>Iśvara will not have the desire to punish (the prapanna), nor can it be said that if the Omnipotent Lord desires to panish and if pardon be not obtained, there will be no evil result following (for when He has once willed, the result must take place, for He is Almighty). If it be held that the offence would only cause the absence of pleasure to the Lord, then if that displeasure would not cause any evil (to the man), there would be no need to perform a later prāyaścitta (which is distinctly ordained in the passage cited above.) If it be held that the utmost that would happen (on account of the offence) is only absence of pleasure to oneself in addition to that of the Lord, the evil consequences, namely, absence of pleasure will have to be admitted. It may be said :-(Let there be absence of pleasure; absence of pleasure being only a particular form of knowledge, it would last only for an instant). There is no reason for performing a prayascitta in connection with the absence of one&rsquo;s own pleasure which has passed away. It it is said that the expiation or prāyaścitta is intended only to avoid the absence of pleasure in oneself that might continue, then, there is every reason to perform expiation owing to the fear that the sufferings stated in the śrutis and the smṛtis (for non-performance of ordained rites and observances - nitya and naimittika ) would follow when the time comes for its fruition, for these sufferings are on the same footing as this displeasure ).</p>
<p>Therefore in order to avoid (1) these sufferings and (2) the interruption to the enjoyment of the Lord (Bhagavad anubhava) here and the diminution of it caused by the weakness of the senses, the fading of the intelligence, sorrow and the like and (3) in the case of those whose term of life has not already been unalterably fixed, delay in the ultimate gain, viz., mokṣa by the extension of the age limit - in order that this may not happen, prapatti has to be performed again. Even those who hold the opinion that this is not required will have to concede that the performance of this latter prapatti will be pardoned by the Lord (even if it be considered as an offence ), since they hold the opinion that the Lord will forgive (even ) the doing of forbidden things.</p>
<p>We have already explained that it is not possible to perform prapatti in anticipation for offences that might be committed deliberately in future and that there is nothing improper in performing a later prapatti in order to obtain a fruit or object which was not prayed for in the previous prapatti (in the chapter on Expiation for Offences ). Thus it may be understood that there is nothing improper in observing the code of conduct followed by the good and arising from the commands of the Lord, (viz., nitya and naimittika ).</p>

<p>He who maintains the view that the prapanna will not be tainted even when he does forbidden things, - why does he view. with anger those who, in accordance with the Lord&rsquo;s commands, observe the code of conduct ordained as proper ?</p>
<p>When it is held (by these disputants) that even when the (Lord&rsquo;s) commands are violated, He would not fail to protect, how could it be said that He would withhold His protection when His commands are performed ?</p>
<p>No form of service (to the Lord) is proper without right conduct. When a man has not made himself clean, he is not fit to worship the Lord.</p>
<p>Dharma is born of right conduct: and the Lord of Dharma is Acyuta.&rdquo; The meaning of all the śāstras is explained in these words in the fifth Veda (Mahābhārata).</p>
<p>The remembrance of the prapatti (performed before ) which is taught by the wise is for the purpose of giving up such prāyascittas as one is not competent to perform and the performance of such others as one is competent for,</p>
<p>When prapatti is remembered, the thought will arise that sins committed in ignorance will cause no taint. It will also be understood that when they are committed deliberately, the performance of a further prapatti is necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore the wise man should remain without committing any offence. But when offences have occurred, the proper thing to do would be another prapatti&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The activities of the man who performed prapatti ( at first) praying that he should be sinless and of the man who performed a further prapatti in order that his later life may be free from sin will invariably be free from sin.</p>
<p>PRĀYASCHITTA FOR DELIBERATE OFFENCES</p>
<p>IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY:</p>
<p>Some may say, in (utter) disregard of texts to the contrary, that (even ) the offences committed deliberately by the prapanna would be pardoned, their opinion being based on certain incidents in the Itihāsas and the Purāṇas. This contention, too, arises from an ignorance of the real opinions in the respective contexts. (For instance) when Sugrīva transgressed the time fixed by him for carrying out the terms of the alliance, the offence caused the appearance of great grief in Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s mind and he said, &ldquo;The way in which Vālin was slain is not yet closed. Abide by the terms of the agreement, O Sugrīva. Do not go the way of Vālin.&rdquo; On hearing these words, Lakṣmaṇa became so angry that the Lord had to bring down his wrath. He went to Sugrīva (to denounce him). On that occasion, did not (Hanuman), the scholar versed in the science of Indra&rsquo;s grammer, counsel Sugrīva as follows:- &ldquo;I do not see any other means for you, the offender, to escape from this situation except by begging the pardon of Lakṣmaṇa with folded hands&rdquo;. Sugrīva, too, accepted this advice and said to Lakṣman. &ldquo;If out of over-confidence or out of affection, I have transgressed in any way, pray, let the offence of your servant be pardoned&rdquo;. And Lakṣmaṇa too, had to seek Sugrīva&rsquo;s pardon for overstepping the proper bounds of speech by</p>
<p>saying:- &ldquo;Pardon me for any harsh words that I may have uttered after listening to the words of Śrī Rāma in his grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus even in the life of a prapanna, offences may occur deliberately, owing to past karma which has begun to operate (prārabdha). When they have occurred, the prapanna should repent and obtain pardon. When Aḷavandār says &ldquo;I have not</p>
<p>observed dharma (i.e.) karmayoga etc&rdquo; and when it is said, &ldquo;I have given up the rites that are to be performed by a Brahmin after ablution in the form of adoration to the three sacrificial fires&rsquo;&rsquo;, it means only this much that he was not capable of such things as karma yoga and not that we should give up the observance of the Lord&rsquo;s commands (nitya and naimittika), in so far as it lies in our power.</p>
<p>Therefore even to a prapanna, action in obedience to the commands of the Lord and in accordance with the respective caste is an obligation that should be carried out until the bodies characterised by such things as Brahmin-ness are cast off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The service to the Lord of Śrī (Lakṣmī) should be performed according to one&rsquo;s ability and for its own sake, with the observance of all the restraints and regulations (nyāsa) prescribed (in the śāstras), in regard to the food to be eaten. the obtaining of knowledge (or the receiving of gifts ), the traditional mantra to be employed in the performance of rites and so also in regard to the acquisition of wealth and in regard to the respective caste and such like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is superior excellence in a person (adhikārī) if, among the ordinary ways of right conduct, there is to be found in him the purity of conduct arising from the many purificatory ceremonies prescribed in the śāstras. So also there is superior excellence in the man who, in addition to the qualities of the spirit, such as self control, has also compassion to living beings. Superior also is the excellence of the man who, among all means of attaining his ends, adopts bhakti or prapatti There is also a supreme excellence in the man who, among all things desired as ends, chooses only mokṣa. (The śloka may also mean):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superior is the excellence of the man who has the qualities of the spirit such as self-control and compassion to that of the man who merely follows the right code of conduct; superior is the man who has chosen the right upāya (bhakti or prapatti) to him who has only the qualities of the spirit; superior still is the man who has chosen the right end (namely) mokṣa to the man who has only chosen the right upāya&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This determination of the potency (of prapatti) should be borne in mind as being connected with the quality of Iśvara as the controller indicated in the three mysteries (mantras).</p>

<p>Our ācāryas have declared that those who have understood the real import of the infallible words (in the carama śloka ) uttered by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, whose attributes and actions are wonderful, who is full of compassion and who has greater regard than for Himself to His servants that endure their existence only by His grace (or who shows His great regard to His servants by giving them His own likeness) – our ācāryas hive declared that those who have understood the real import of Śrī Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s words will never approve the non-observance of the way of life ordained in the Veda or Vedānta.</p>

<p>Since the differences arising from such things as the four castes and the four āśramas have been ordained (in the śāstras), those who follow the line of conduct prescribed therein, whose conduct is also consistent with such attributes as devotion to the Lord</p>
<p>and who are proficient in the knowledge of the injunctions concerning prapatti, which are diametrically opposed to the non observance of the rites and duties pertaining to each caste and each asramu - these men of exclusive devotion to the Lord may be found even in this last yuga, and they will approve of the enquiry made so far (in this chapter).</p>
